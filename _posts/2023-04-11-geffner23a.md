title: Langevin Diffusion Variational Inference
software: https://github.com/tomsons22/LDVI
abstract: 'Many methods that build powerful variational distributions based on unadjusted
  Langevin transitions exist. Most of these were developed using a wide range of different
  approaches and techniques. Unfortunately, the lack of a unified analysis and derivation
  makes developing new methods and reasoning about existing ones a challenging task.
  We address this giving a single analysis that unifies and generalizes these existing
  techniques. The main idea is to augment the target and variational by numerically
  simulating the underdamped Langevin diffusion process and its time reversal. The
  benefits of this approach are twofold: it provides a unified formulation for many
  existing methods, and it simplifies the development of new ones. In fact, using
  our formulation we propose a new method that combines the strengths of previously
  existing algorithms; it uses underdamped Langevin transitions and powerful augmentations
  parameterized by a score network. Our empirical evaluation shows that our proposed
  method consistently outperforms relevant baselines in a wide range of tasks.'
